			Connecting doctors is our primary aim. Doctors Know other doctors but knowing basic information about the other doctor has being a problem when it comes to referring patients to those doctors.
			CHRMS as come in to create that link so that doctors will have full information about other doctors, which hospital and which town the doctors are, making it very simple to be very specific when referring a patient other hospitals and which department that patient should go. With all this doctors have the ability to check regularly the status of their refered patient. All that is handled by CHRMS.
		</p>
		<h3 style="color: #80CBC4;">High quality care</h3>
		<p>
			Being competent at what you do is just one aspect of high quality care. Treating your     
		    patients with respect, taking time to answer their questions, and checking up on them after treatment builds your reputation as a provider that cares. CHRMS helps you to get that compentency by providing you with regular patients referrals check ups and notify the reffered doctor if he or share forgot about the case.

		<p>
			Referring patients to other hospitals or to other doctors by written note is really time consuming and ineffient when it comes to keeping track of the patient status.
			With CHRMS simple referral processing forms, you get to write what you want most from the other facility. We handle the load for you and keep track by updating you when your patient was received by the referred facility. The forward and backward process of referring and getting back your patient makes CHRMS very simple. Doctors don't have to worry about the referral they have made, because CHRMS does all the worrying for you.  
			
		</p>

		<h3 style="text-align: left; color: #80CBC4">Timely appointments</h3>
		<p>
			Referring physicians hate to have their patients’ care delayed because the patient     
		    can’t get in to see you in a timely way. CHRMS makes special effort to accommodate the referred request as soon    
		    as possible (and let the doctor quickly see them). And be sure to let the referring practice   
		    know that the referred request has been received and under processing.
