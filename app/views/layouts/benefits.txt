1-High quality care:
 Being competent at what you do is just one aspect of high quality care. Treating your     
    patients with respect, taking time to answer their questions, and checking up on them after treatment  
    builds your reputation as a provider that cares.

2-Timely appointments:
 Referring physicians hate to have their patients’ care delayed because the patient     
    can’t get in to see you in a timely way. Make a special effort to accommodate the referred patient as soon    
    as possible (and see them quickly once they arrive at your office). And be sure to let the referring practice   
    know that the appointment has been made. 

3- Prompt understandable reports:
 Let the referring practice know when the patient has been scheduled,     
    that you appreciate the referral and that you will continue to communicate about what follows. If you  
    need to refer the patient to another specialist, consult with the referring office first. Always keep them in     
    control of their patient, and keep them informed with regular progress reports.

4- Hassle-free interactions with office staff:
 Your staff needs to be responsive and courteous to the doctors    
    and staff members who refer patients to you. 

5- Willingness to take their fair share of
 tough cases:
 Referring doctors hate when you refuse to take a  
    “lesser” case after they’ve sent you many good-paying case

6- Acceptance of
 the patients’
 insurance:
Many doctors will only refer patients to specialists who accept  
    their patients’ insurance.

7- The assurance that they will send the patient back:
 One reason doctors are reluctant to send patients to    
    someone they don’t have a strong relationship with is that they are afraid their patient will be stolen from   
    them. So always send the patient back to the referring doctor, with some deliberate process steps and a  
    bit of ceremony, if necessary, to make sure they notice.
